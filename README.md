## 📚 Research: VPN Encryption & Privacy
- **Encryption** → VPN encrypts all internet traffic using protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard, or IKEv2, making it unreadable to ISPs or hackers.
- **Privacy** → Hides your real IP, masking your location and identity.
- **Tunneling Protocols** → Securely route traffic between your device and VPN server.
- **Protection Against Tracking** → Prevents websites and advertisers from building a tracking profile.
